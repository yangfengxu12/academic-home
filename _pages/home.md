I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [School of Information Science and Technology](https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/sist_en) at [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/) in Shanghai, China, supervised by [Prof. Zhice Yang](https://yangzhice.com). I was admitted to the Ph.D. program after completing my master’s training at the [Shanghai Advanced Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.sari.ac.cn) (2019–2022), where I worked with Prof. Jiangming Wei and was mentored by [Dr. Xiaoyuan Ma](https://maxiaoyuan.com). I received my bachelor’s degree from the School of Information and Communication Engineering, North University of China, in Taiyuan, Shanxi, China, in 2018.


## Research Interests
{: #research}

My research primarily focuses on **LiDAR-centric perception and the security and privacy of autonomous driving systems**. Previously, I worked on wireless network coexistence, heterogeneous networking, and cross-technology communication to enable robust connectivity for embedded devices.
