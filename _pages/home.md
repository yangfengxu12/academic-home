I am a Ph.D. candidate at [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/), advised by [Prof. Zhice Yang](https://yangzhice.com). Previously, I trained at the [Shanghai Advanced Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.sari.ac.cn) (2019–2022) and received my B.S. from North University of China in 2018.

<p style="color: #d73a49; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1em;">🔴 I am currently on the job market for postdoctoral positions!</p>

## Research Interests
{: #research}

My research primarily focuses on **LiDAR-centric perception and the security and privacy of autonomous driving systems**. Previously, I worked on wireless network coexistence, heterogeneous networking, and cross-technology communication to enable robust connectivity for embedded devices.
